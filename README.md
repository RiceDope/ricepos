# Welcome to RicePos

*Currently nothing is in the project this is the base for where the project will be worked on*

The aim of the project is to create a rough point of sale system. This is my first attempt with using OpenJfx and Maven. Any important messages will be displayed at the top of this README in *italics*.

## Running the project
*This may be simple to some but for me this took a while to get my head around so here goes*

The following are all cmd commands to be run in the root directory of the project *ricepos*

```
mvn package

java -cp target/ricepos-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.rhyswalker.ricepos.App
```

In order to run the project you must have OpenJfx installed at version 21.0.1 and Java JDK21. You might get away with previous version but I haven't tested yet.

Any issues encountered when compiling the project then please let me know and I will try to address them. Known issues will be displayed at the top of the page.

# Notes

- This is technically my second attempt at this program. The first attempt didn't use Maven and I wanted to start again doing things in the correct way. Code from the previous attempt will be reused.

- Please if you have any advice on improvement to the code and general layout then let me know.
